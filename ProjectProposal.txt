Application: MP3 Player
I’m thinking of making a MP3 player with basic functionalities like:

Play
Pause
Forward 
Backward
Volume up and down
Loop song
Shuffle list
Shows album art

User can also add their playlist & favourites. And if possible, I also want to add an equalizer in the music player.
We can use it on any updated browser on pc. 

Why I want to make this? Music is as much important as any other thing in our life. And this app will give a personalized experience to the user. 

Technology I’m going use is HTML, JS, CSS.
